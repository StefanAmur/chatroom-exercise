# Chatroom exercise (with Socket.IO)

This is an exercise during my [BeCode](https://becode.org/) training in which we had to make a basic chat application using Node and Socket.IO.

## Exercise type & duration

We had 2️⃣ days to complete it (02/12-03/12) and it was a solo exercise.

## Must have features

- ✔Make a UI that makes it easy for people to send messages in this chatroom
- ✔It must be possible to send a message to everyone or to yourself
- ✔Make sure we can identify who sent the message through a username
  - ✔We could make a local variable and prompt the user to choose a username
  - ✔We can then emit this username along with the sent message to keep track of who sent what
- ✔Make a list to show everyone who is connected to the chatroom
- ❌Implement something funny! The sky is the limit! (it can be very simple if you want)
  - For example, you could make a functionality to make someone else's font size obscurely small!
  - You could implement a feature where you can speak with someone else's username

## How did it go?

The clear steps and instructions that we got were very helpful. The showing of the users connected was the hardest and while it does work, it could be improved. While it does show the users, they don't get removed if the user disconnects.  
I also forgot about the something funny part until I wrote this readme 😩

## Nice-to-have features

- ❌You could implement a feature where you can speak with someone else's
  - username
  - password
  - avatar
  - font-color
- ❌You can make different rooms to join by code
- ❌Make it possible to send private messages to a person
- ❌Add images, emojis, videos, gifs to your messages
- ❌Make a login / registration (a bit more difficult)
